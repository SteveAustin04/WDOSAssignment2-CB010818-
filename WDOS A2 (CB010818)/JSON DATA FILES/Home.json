        "description": "Sri Lanka is an island covering 65,610 km2 that is located near the southeast tip of the Indian peninsula. Sri Lanka has a high degree of biodiversity in spite of its tiny size. An impressive aspect of Sri Lanka's biodiversity is the remarkably high percentage of endemic species found in both its flora and fauna: 16% of the island's mammals and 23% of its flowering plants are endemic. The unique characteristics of Sri Lanka's biodiversity are a result of the country's extensive topographic and climatic diversity."

        "description": "Sri Lanka is home to 103 rivers. The Mahaweli River, which stretches 335 kilometers (208 mi),is the longest of these. There are fifty-one (10 m/33 ft) or higher natural waterfalls originating from these waterways. At 263 meters (863 feet) high, Bambarakanda Falls is the highest. The length of Sri Lanka's coast is 1,585 km (985 mi). An exclusive economic zone stretching 200 nautical miles—roughly 6.7 times the size of Sri Lanka's land area—is claimed by the country. Highly productive marine ecosystems, such as shallow beds of coastal and estuarine seagrasses and fringing coral reefs, are supported by the coastline and nearby waters"

The Gulf of Mannar has been shown to contain gas and petroleum, and recoverable amounts are currently being extracted. Minerals are abundant on the island"
